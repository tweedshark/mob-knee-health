      <h2>Key Exercises</h2>
      <p>Focus on controlled movements. Aim for 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions unless otherwise noted. Listen to your body.</p>

      <article class="exercise">
        <h3>Glute Bridge</h3>
        <p><strong>Targets:</strong> Glutes, hamstrings, core.</p>
        <p>Lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Engage your core and lift your hips off the floor until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. Hold for 2-3 seconds, then slowly lower.</p>
        <p><em>Reps: 12-15. Sets: 2-3.</em></p>
      </article>

      <article class="exercise">
        <h3>Bird-Dog</h3>
        <p><strong>Targets:</strong> Core stability, glutes, lower back.</p>
        <p>Start on all fours, with hands directly under shoulders and knees directly under hips. Extend one arm straight forward and the opposite leg straight back, keeping your core engaged and back flat. Hold for 2-3 seconds, then slowly return to the starting position. Switch sides.</p>
        <p><em>Reps: 10-12 per side. Sets: 2-3.</em></p>
      </article>

      <article class="exercise">
        <h3>Wall Sit</h3>
        <p><strong>Targets:</strong> Quadriceps, glutes, endurance.</p>
        <p>Lean against a wall with your feet shoulder-width apart and slide down until your knees are bent at a 90-degree angle, as if you're sitting in a chair. Ensure your knees are directly above your ankles. Hold the position.</p>
        <p><em>Hold: 30-60 seconds. Sets: 2-3.</em></p>
      </article>

      <article class="exercise">
        <h3>Lateral Band Walks</h3>
        <p><strong>Targets:</strong> Gluteus medius (hip abductors), knee stability.</p>
        <p>Place a resistance band around your ankles or just above your knees. Stand with feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent in an athletic stance. Step sideways, keeping tension on the band and your knees aligned over your feet. Take 10-15 steps in one direction, then switch directions.</p>
        <p><em>Reps: 10-15 steps per side. Sets: 2-3.</em></p>
      </article>

      <article class="exercise">
        <h3>Single-Leg Deadlift (Bodyweight)</h3>
        <p><strong>Targets:</strong> Hamstrings, glutes, balance, core stability.</p>
        <p>Stand on one leg with a slight bend in the knee. Hinge at your hips, extending the other leg straight behind you for balance. Lower your torso until it's almost parallel to the floor, or as far as comfortable while maintaining a flat back. Return to the starting position. Focus on control, not speed.</p>
        <p><em>Reps: 8-12 per side. Sets: 2-3.</em></p>

      <h2>Important Tips & Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Never push through sharp pain. Modify or skip exercises if they cause discomfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm-Up:</strong> Always perform a dynamic warm-up before strength sessions or rides (e.g., leg swings, arm circles, light cardio).</li>
        <li><strong>Cool-Down:</strong> Include static stretching (like the mobility routine) after workouts.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency is Key:</strong> Regular, moderate effort is more beneficial than occasional intense sessions.</li>
        <li>Avoid deep squats or lunges past 90 degrees during knee flare-ups.</li>
        <li>Skip jumping or plyometric moves until strength, control, and stability are solid.</li>
        <li>Track post-ride knee stability and any discomfort on a 1–5 scale to identify patterns.</li>
        <li>Prioritize recovery—active recovery like stretching or walking the day after strenuous rides can be very beneficial.</li>
        <li><strong>Proper Form Over Weight/Intensity:</strong> Focus on executing each exercise correctly to maximize benefits and minimize injury risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydration and Nutrition:</strong> Support your body's recovery and performance with adequate water intake and a balanced diet.</li>
      </ul>
